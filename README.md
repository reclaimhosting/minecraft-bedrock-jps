# Minecraft Bedrock Server for Reclaim Cloud
In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools, build structures or earthworks, and depending on game mode, can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Minecraft servers allow players to play online or via a local area network with other people. This installs the Bedrock variant of Minecraft server.
